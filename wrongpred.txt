08-13 15:28 root         DEBUG    This dance is not a traditional dance . Ballet -LSB- ˈbæleɪ -RSB- -LRB- -LSB- balɛ -RSB- -RRB- is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia . It has since become a widespread , highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology . It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres . Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training . Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world , which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art . Ballet may also refer to a ballet dance work , which consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production . A well-known example of this is The Nutcracker , a two-act ballet that was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov with a music score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky . Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained artists . Traditional classical ballets usually are performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging , whereas modern ballets , such as the neoclassical works of American choreographer George Balanchine , often are performed in simple costumes -LRB- e.g. , leotards and tights -RRB- and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery .

Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted musical genres such as blues , jazz , rag-time , funk , and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide . Neo soul is a genre of popular music . Soul music -LRB- often referred to simply as soul -RRB- is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s . By 1968 , the soul music genre had begun to splinter . Media coverage usually derided the genre 's name , its reliance on nostalgia , and the ubiquitous mention of `` the summer '' in its writings . Coinciding with the economic turmoil of the late 2000s and early 2010s recession , chillwave was one of the first music genres to develop by being linked and defined through various outlets on the Internet rather than geographic location . Sometimes regarded as a `` made-up '' genre , the movement 's vanguard was represented by Neon Indian , Washed Out , and Toro y Moi , who gained critical attention through what was termed the 2009 `` Summer of Chillwave '' . Washed Out 's 2009 track `` Feel It All Around '' remains the genre 's definitive and best-known song . Witch house -LRB- also known as drag or haunted house -RRB- is an occult-themed dark electronic music genre and visual aesthetic that emerged in the early 2010s . Rhythm and blues , often abbreviated as R&B or RnB , is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s . The lyrics in this genre of music focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships , freedom , economics , aspirations , and sex .
